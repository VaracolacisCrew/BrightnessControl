## INTRODUCTION
This is a little application developed for me because I wanted to change the brightness on my desktop depending on the time of day

There are some paied applications, but I know how to code so... why not.

And I decided to code this little tool and share it with anyone.

&nbsp;

## DESCRIPTION
    THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS TOOL
    THERE MAY BE BUGS AND THERE ARE MISSING FUNCTIONS


### FUNCTIONS
    you can change the brightness of the screen with ease and program a cicle.
    The app will sleep for the time it needs till it needs to change the brightness. so very little resources are used
    The brightness can change using a falloff so it does not goes from one brightness lvl to another in a second (you can always put a 0 there)
